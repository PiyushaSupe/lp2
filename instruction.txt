1.	Case study on Amazon EC2 and learn about Amazon EC2 web services.
(Create an EC2 Instance and upload a sample webpage or application on it) 
2.	Installation and configure Google App Engine.
(After installation and configuration, deploy any Java/Python application on it)

3.	Creating an Application in SalesForce using Apex Programming Language.
(Write any Apex program for any application e.g. Calculator, any java code for ex-prime number, Fibonacci series, student CRUD operations etc.)  

4.	Design and develop custom application using Salesforce Cloud.
(e.g. any event management application, any CRM application, etc)
For 4th one from CC this building custom application you will take good example like creating bank application or any CRM application or events management application not any basic 2-3 tabs


for apex programming practice below code 
1. Build a Contact-Opportunity Mapper
2. Write an Apex method that calculates a custom field Stage_Progress__c on Account based on the number of opportunities in different stages (e.g., 25% for "Prospecting", 50% for "Negotiation", etc
3. Write a method that generates a custom report for all Opportunity records that have a probability of more than 50% and lists them by CloseDate. This report should be output as a formatted string.
4. Calculator


1.	Implementing DFS and BFS algorithms for searching in graph or tree.
(Implement depth first search algorithm and Breadth First Search algorithm, Use an undirected graph or tree and develop a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.)
2.	Implement A star Algorithm for any game search problem.
(Apply A star algorithm for Maze Solver problem and show the final path from start to goal.)
3.	Implement Greedy search algorithm for Selection Sort application

4.	Implement Greedy search algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree application
5.	Implement a solution for a Constraint Satisfaction Problem using Branch and Bound and Backtracking for n-queens problem or a graph colouring problem.
(Implement both Branch and bound And Backtracking methods for 4 queens problem or graph colouring problem)  
above one are for AI  You will get 1 problem statement from AI or CC '
